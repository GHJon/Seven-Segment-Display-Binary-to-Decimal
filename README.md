# Seven-Segment-Display-Binary-to-Decimal
This project covers the fundamenals of working both the Altera DE2 and DE1-SOC boards to display signed and unsigned numbers.
The user must use the first 8 switches of both boards to put in numbers between 0 and 255 (unsigned) and -128 and 127 (signed).
The 9th switch is used to control the board logic that changes between signed and unsigned mode.


This project has taught me several things such as:

1. Learning VHDL syntax in conjuction with FPGA boards
2. Understanding the usage of decoders
3. Control of both the DE2 and DE1-SOC boards via VHDL and pin assigmnents from the boards
  3a. Control of both signed and unsigned logic using swithces on the board.
